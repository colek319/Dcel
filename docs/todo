1 Resolve circular dependencies in vertex/hedge/face classes.

0 Consider base functions that DCEL will support.

0 Complete design

0 determine structure invariants

0 implement invariant functions

0 determine string metaformat

0 add and remove data

0 IMPORTANT: remove verbose pointers. Instead, just use
	strings and a std::map for every item. (I think this
    will be easier than silly pointer management, but
    we should talk about it)

0 understand advanced features of c++ to the degree that
	we don't feel like our code is spaghetti code

0 represent a polygon and do things with it

0 get convex hull of a pointset

0 test as a data structure in a c++ visualization (voronoi
	diagram, US map where we can select states and see data,
    anything we can think of realy.

0 build language (maybe hold off)
